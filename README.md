React  - is an external library that helps to create websites
We can load js with the help of tag script:
1. just pit in js code directly
2. Connect js file from the project
3. connect external library

Consists of 2 libraries:
1. React = shared features (mobile + websites)
2. ReactDOM = features specific to websites
3. ReactNative = features specific to mobile

If you use React for websites you need to load both libs(React + ReactDOM), for mobile you good to go with React + ReactNative

What is Babel? Its js compiler, basicly it translate js to another langs
When using React we don't use JS we use an enhanced version of JS => JSX(JavaScript XML)
JSX  = same as JS but we can writ HTML directly in our JS code
But our website doesnt understand jsx and babel helps to translate this to normal js.
We need to use script with type "text/babel"

Why React popular?
- Creating React elements is natural
- jsx makes it easier to find errors
- we can insert JS code into  JSX elements

Components - a piece of website
Component name starts with capital letter and PascalCase
JSX all components require closing tag or if no content than we can use self-closing tags
We can use only one value of a function

We can add component with the cirly brackets and also with component sysntax
With the help of React our own html elements = main idea of React if there is nothing inside we can use self-closing tag

To group elements wo unnecessary divs we can use fragments


In React we use div for layout purposes

Components are designed to be reusable, every component accept one parameter called props = object that contains all the parameters we gave to this component
